Day trading - 15/30 min for trend, 1/5min for timing. intra-day volatility/volume important here - invest in the morning just after market settles from overnight, or before market closes
Swing trading - days, weeks, but use hours for fine-tuning entry and exithigh volumes in peak trading hours lead to lower spreads and more volatility (which gives you better chance of covering cost)
Factors: 
Modelling: model,features,hyper parameters
Data: intervals, history
Timing of entry / exit: volatility


To do:
logistic with just lags
dnn with just lags
log with lags + technical
dnn + technical
think through optimisation per above and that lecture on optimisation
